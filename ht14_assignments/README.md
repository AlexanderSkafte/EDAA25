EDAA25
======

My solutions for the assignments in the C programming course held at LTH.

## Doing the EDAA25 course in autumn 2015?

The course has changed since 2014. You may look at calculator (RPN) for
a conceptual overview of how to write the program, but it is *not* the
same as this year's RPN calculator assignment.

There was no *Word* assignment 2014. Instead it was a program to calculate
factorial of arbitrary size.

**Polynomial does not work!!!**. Keep that in mind, and you should be fine
:)

Best regards,
Alexander
